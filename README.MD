## OLD Word

- **BEFORE UPGRADING to - todo list - nextjs api routes** 
- "UPGRADING and recovering my knowledge on old projects, better than creating new projects with the same ideas .. boring, isn't it? as the goal is to have many repos.. 
- I'll use nextjs a
pi routes not becuase i didn't complete the app in express BUT just because to benfit more by this project in order to showc
ase my skills in nextjs, as i am a front-end even if nextjs makes me fullstack.. - I think i should thank nextjs for that by UPDARDING :))
